# Efficiency-Aware-MPC-for-EV-Cabin-TM
Cabin cooling under hot-weather conditions imposes a considerable energy demand on electric vehicles, significantly constraining driving range. This repository develops an adaptive efficiency-aware MPC strategy for automotive air-conditioning (AC) systems, integrating a control-oriented thermodynamic model, a predictive optimization framework.
